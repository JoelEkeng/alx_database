## Introduction

A database is a structured collection of data that allows efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information. SQL, the standard language for working with relational databases, enables users to interact with databases by writing queries to retrieve, manipulate, and transform data.

This guide provides step-by-step tutorials, code examples, and explanations to help you grasp the fundamental concepts of databases and SQL. By the end of this guide, you will be equipped with the skills to create, manage, and query databases effectively.

## Getting Started

If you're new to databases and SQL, start here to understand the basics. This section covers:
- What is a database and why it's important.
- Setting up a local development environment.
- Installing and configuring a relational database management system (RDBMS).

## Core Concepts

Dive deeper into core database concepts to build a solid foundation. Topics covered include:
- Relational databases and their components.
- Tables, rows, and columns.
- Primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
